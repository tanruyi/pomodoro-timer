# Pomodoro-Timer

This is a web app that I'm doing as the Final Project as part of Harvard's CS50x course.

I will be attempting to make a web app that is similar to the https://studywithme.io/aesthetic-pomodoro-timer/

# Tech Stack
- Python / Flask
- HTML
- CSS

# Instructions
To run the web app, use the command `flask --app main run` in the terminal
